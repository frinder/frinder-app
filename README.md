# *Frinder* [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/frinder/frinder-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/frinder/frinder-app/builds)

**Frinder** is an android app matches you to people nearby who are also looking to meet new people (not focussed on dating). e.g.: while you are waiting for a flight, having lunch alone, traveling by the train

Have you found yourself in the following situations when you were bored and could use some conversation? - Waiting for a flight alone - Taking the train by yourself - At a bar alone - Having a meal by yourself at your office cafe - At a fair where you barely know anyone. We are sure everyone has some time been in such a situation where they were alone and wouldn't mind meeting a new person. However, the initial conversation or ice-breaker can be particularly awkward.

This app links to your Facebook profile and has a profile that contains basic information about you. On opening the app, you can see nearby people in the area and sent them a notification incase you'd like to meet them. Similar to Tinder, the app notifies you only when the other person reciprocates interest in meeting you. Some additions to this would be a chat functionality and the ability to create interest-based groups (e.g. an IoT focussed ad-hoc group at a computer science conference).
